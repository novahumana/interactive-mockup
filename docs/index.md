# Technical Requirements

> **Note**: Load multiple documents when your task spans different areas.
> For example, a feature that adds a new entity AND creates UI components
> requires both `store-requirements.md` and `code-conventions.md`.

## Code Conventions

Load [./code-conventions.md](./code-conventions.md) for every task. Contains project-wide standards for:

- Component patterns and file organization
- Styling approach (Tailwind, CSS variables, Figma tokens)
- Import conventions and path aliases

## Storage requirements

Load [./store-requirements.md](./store-requirements.md) if your task involves:

- Get or Set items into the LocalStorage
- Creating/modifying business domain entities (Patient, Session, etc.)
- Understanding how entities relate to each other
- Data-access layer code in general
